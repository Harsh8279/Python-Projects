## Hey Everyone, 
Python related Projects are here.
### 1. Generate .csv file from .vcf file
      We mostly care about our contacts and their backups. 
      If we want to share multiple contacts using Phone then we get a file but, that file is vcf (Virtual Contact File) so we can't see the content of that using phone. 
      We have to import that file into our contact and then we can see those contacts. 
      If we don't want to do this then we are trying to convert that file into another format so we can see and understand it easily. 
      So using this project you can convert your vcf file into CSV without any loss of data and get it in a proper way.Â
